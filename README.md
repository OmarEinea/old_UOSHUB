Website - For UOS Students
---


This website is UOS websites done the right way!<br>
it is a hub that combines all UOS websites in one place,<br>
and displays them in a modern and user friendly way.

Here's one example of how this website changes the way you do and see things,<br>
this is the way the official UOS UDC displays the student schedule (the Old way):

And this is the way UOSHUB displays it (the New way):
